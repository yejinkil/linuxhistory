LINUX began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds:
to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting LINUX kernel has
been marked by constant growth throughout s history. Since the initial release
of s source code in 1991,  has grown from a small number of C files under
a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with
more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under
the GNU General Public License v2

After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system
was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of
AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote
 in a new programming language, C, to make  portable. The availability and
portability of Unix caused  to be widely adopted, copied and modified by
academic institutions and businesses
